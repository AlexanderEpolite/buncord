# Buncord

A work in progress Discord library made for the Bun runtime.

## Not Finished

This library will be worked on in the coming week or so.

Planned supported features:
- Full websocket support with all events for v10
- Support for using Elysia over HTTP for interactions
- Voice connections
- Slash commands

Everything will be fully typed; slash command parameters will appear typed in your methods, like tRPC.
